Oldham were the stronger side for a large portion of the game , ending the game with 58% of possession. Many chances fell to Oldham at the start of the game, most notably Eoin Doyle just missing the mark after a rebounded effort from Duckens Nazon , who had performed a roulette on a defender to get into the space.

However, on the stroke of 37 minutes Kyle Vassel slotted the ball past Haitian Johny Placide to make it 1-0 to Blackpool. 

A spirited second half effort for Oldham Athletic saw them come back to win 2-1. Jack Byrne scored in the 60th minute , only two after he was substituted on for Ben Pringle. The final goal came from Eoin Doyle after 85 minutes to give the Latics' fans the result they wanted (after a nail-biting five minutes of extra time).
