I have taken the first step in making the BAWA group more professional via changing our domain name from www.bawa.netlify.com to www.blueandwhitearmy.org . We hope that this will not only look better but it will be easier for our readers to find the website.

I have also started the Oldham Athletic statistics page , located at [www.blueandwhitearmy.org/data/](www.blueandwhitearmy.org/data/). This will give data such as goals , assists and appearances throughout the season. (**It gets technical here so skip down if you do not want to read it)**If you are confident in using REST APIs then our NodeJS api is available on [www.oafc.herokuapp.com/api/players ](www.oafc.herokuapp.com/api/players). I have not limited the types of requests but ask that people only use GET. 

If you want to suggest any improvements , or if you want to get involved in any way, please send me a message either via [email](mailto:bawanewsofficial@gmail.com) or [twitter](https://twitter.com/bawablog).
