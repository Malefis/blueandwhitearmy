The 30 year old Welshman has been playing for Wigan since the start of the 2016/17 season. Despite not starting a single game last year , MacDonald helped to guide AFC Bournemouth all the way to the championship. He has also had frequent loan spells with Yeovil Town.

With Joe Royle having more involvement at Wigan , it seems as if there could be more fact to this. Only time will tell.
