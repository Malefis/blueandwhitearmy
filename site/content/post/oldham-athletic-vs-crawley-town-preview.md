The visitors Crawley Town are coming off the back of a loss to Port Vale 1-0, a draw to Swindon Town 2-2 and a loss at home to Bury 3-2.

Oldham Athletic are on a 4 game unbeaten streak with draws against Forest Green and Yeovil Town and wins against Macclesfield Town and Morecambe. 

Crawley have ex Latics player Dominic Poleon in their ranks and Oldham have inform striker Chris O'Grady looking to impress again. I am going for a 2-0 win for the Latics.
