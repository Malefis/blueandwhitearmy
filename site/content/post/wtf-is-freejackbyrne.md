  The twitter craze that has taken all Oldham fans who know how to use
  photoshop. I explain the story behind it.

Everything starts in pre-season training, when Ousmane Fane broke his leg and dislocated his ankle. Rumours circulated on social media that Jack Byrne had done this during the training session and was to be punished. Soon after, Byrne was puled out of the pre-season squad and was left training with the youth team.

With the Oldham squad being hit by many injuries (it is still unknown as to whether these are all true), fans were calling for the irishman to start the first game of the season. He did not. Oldham went on to lose the game 2-1 at home.

Fast-forward a week to this Saturday. Oldham are away at Forest Green Rovers , a game seen as easily winnable by most supporters. By the half time mark a dreadful looking away side were losing 1-0. Jose Baxter was brought on and helped the latics to a draw. Many latics fans (including I) were baffled by the fact that the club's best player was not starting so many jokey tweets and images were made under the hashtag 'freejackbyrne'. I advise all fans to take a look at the many brilliant photoshop jobs and jokes.
