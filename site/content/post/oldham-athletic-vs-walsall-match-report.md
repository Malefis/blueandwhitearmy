Walsall opened the scoring on the stroke of the 34th minute , with Jack Fitzwater heading home after a parry by Jonny Placide.

Oldham dominated the play for the first half of the match on this very cold night. The players were stringing many good passes together however they were finding it hard to work in the final third. Oldham’s luck changes just before half time with Duckens Nazon bearing multiple defenders and slotting the ball past the goalkeeper.

The second half was very bleak, with neither sides really showing chance of scoring

The game slowly eased it’s way into the end where both sets of fans sounded quite dissatisfied with their team’s performance.
