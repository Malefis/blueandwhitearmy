Today, Oldham Athletic faced Gillingham at home. Oldham were the better team for most of the game , with them showing this when Duckens Nazon scored a great skillfull goal just before half time. 

It was an eventful second half, with their being many chances for both sides , notably Johny Placide stopping the ball on the line after a great shot. However, after 90 minutes left-back Wilfried Moimbe was sent off for violent conduct , I have still not seen any video evidence of this , but if this is true then he will receive a three match ban.

The referee made many terrible decisions in the game , I would personally say that this is the worst referreing that I have seen all season at Boundary Park. The red card to Moimbe also handed over a penalty to Gillingham , which striker Tom Eaves easily slotted below the keeper.

This result leaves the 'latics 1 point above the relegation zone with five games to go.
