Wellens stepped up to the job as manager of the club when John Sheridan left  via mutual consent on the 25th September 2017.

Fans enjoyed excellen t football with the club staying unbeaten for many games. However all good thing come to an end and the results started to become worse. Eventually , Oldham Athletic were relegated to Football League Two at the end of the 2017/18 season after spending 21 seasons in the 3rd tier of English football.

In a statement, the club said 'Whilst he was unable to guide us to League One safety after being appointed in October, it certainly wasnâ€™t due to a lack of professionalism and dedication on his part and we wish him every success for the future.'

He is now the 9th manager to have departed the club since February 2015.

We will be sure to bring updates on any rumors of new appointments.
